In this assignment, you will take the HTML fundamentals page, and style it using CSS. Try to avoid making changes to the HTML itself.

Required Features:

• All text on the page should use a sans-serif font family.

• The page should be 1024 pixels wide, and be centered on the page, with equal margins to the left and right.

• Give the page the appearance of the example placed in picture below, using only your own CSS code.

• (The gray boxes show where elements should be positioned – you do not need them to appear as gray boxes on the page).

Code Requirements:

• All the CSS code should come from the same file and be linked into the HTML file through a link tag – there should be no style tags or style attributes in the HTML file at all.

Optional:

• The second paragraph of the first article element should be written in bold text, with a blue text color
.
• In the unordered list in the side content, items should appear in alternating colors (green and red, as a suggestion).


Subjects Covered:

• CSS
